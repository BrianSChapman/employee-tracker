# employee-tracker

## Description

Utilizing new tools as we transition to backend development, I was tasked with creating an employee tracker using Mysql and Node (with Inquirer). Building out a Command Line question prompt to give a non-developer the ability to comfortably and confidently navigate through departments, employees, roles within the company, and the the ability to modify several parameters on the directory. 

## Installation

This application requires the npm install of [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) to successfully navigating the question prompt. That's it. You can run this in your command line interface of your choice.

## Usage

Upon opening that command line and installing the inquirer package via npm, type in **npm run start** and you'll prompted with a list of questions to answer. Based upon what you ask or what information you provide, you will receive information via Mysql tables.
